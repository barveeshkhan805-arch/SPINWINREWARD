## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vibrant blue (#29ABE2) to convey trust and security in financial transactions, contrasting with a light background.
- Background color: Light blue (#E0F7FA), a desaturated variant of the primary color, creating a calm and trustworthy environment.
- Accent color: Energetic orange (#FFB300), analogous to blue, to highlight call-to-action buttons and important notifications, driving user engagement.
- Font pairing: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for headlines, providing a modern and precise look; 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body text, ensuring readability and a slightly warmer feel. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Custom, playful icons for each navigation section (Earn, Withdrawal, History, Profile) to enhance visual appeal.
- Clean, modern layout with a focus on usability. Bottom navigation should be fixed for easy access.
- Smooth, engaging animations for the spin wheel, points accumulation, and transitions between screens to improve user experience and create a polished feel.
