    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure is designed to securely manage user data, spin results, and withdrawal requests for the SpinWin Rewards application. It uses path-based ownership for user-specific data, ensuring only the user can access their own information. The design prioritizes authorization independence by avoiding `get()` calls in security rules. A dedicated `referral_codes` collection is used to allow for referral code lookups without violating security rules that prevent listing all users.\n\n*   `/users/{userId}`: Stores user profiles. All documents in this collection share the same security requirements (only the user can read/write their own profile). This collection segregation contributes to QAPs.\n*   `/users/{userId}/spin_results/{spinResultId}`: Stores spin results for each user. This path enforces ownership. The structure inherently supports secure `list` operations because each user's spin results are isolated within their own path, satisfying QAPs.\n*   `/users/{userId}/withdrawal_requests/{withdrawalRequestId}`: Stores withdrawal requests made by each user. Similar to spin results, this ensures that users can only access their own withdrawal requests, supporting secure `list` operations (QAPs).\n*   `/referral_codes/{referralCode}`: Maps a referral code to a `userId`. This allows the application to verify a referral code via a direct `get` operation, which is secure and efficient, avoiding an insecure query across the entire `users` collection.\n\nThis structure avoids the need for complex authorization logic or `get()` calls in security rules. Each collection is structurally segregated based on ownership, enabling efficient and secure data access, and simplified security rules."
